Google Maps API and Python scraper are 2 effective methods to scrape Google Maps details.

Google Maps scraping is the process of extracting information such as business names, locations, and reviews from Google Maps using automated tools or scripts.

In this blog post, we will discuss the benefits of scraping Google Maps and walk through how to accomplish this using Python and automated tools.

## What Are the Benefits of Scraping Google Maps?
Scraping Google Maps provides valuable business intelligence and location-based insights. Here are the key benefits:

âœ… **Extract Business Information** â€“ Gather essential details such as business name, address, phone number, website, ratings, reviews, and opening hours. This data is useful for lead generation, directory listings, and customer outreach.

âœ… **Conduct Market Analysis and Competitor Research** â€“ Analyze market trends, identify key competitors, and assess business density in specific locations. This helps businesses make informed decisions about expansion, pricing strategies, and customer engagement.

âœ… **Enhance Geographic Data Visualization and Optimization** â€“ Improve service coverage, optimize delivery routes, and plan store locations based on real-world business distributions. Companies can use this data to enhance operational efficiency and customer accessibility.

## Challenges of Scraping Google Maps
Scraping Google Maps comes with significant challenges due to its strict anti-scraping mechanisms. Google imposes rate limits, CAPTCHAs, and API restrictions to prevent automated data extraction, making large-scale scraping difficult without encountering blocks.

Another challenge is the dynamic nature of Google Maps, which relies on JavaScript to load business information. Traditional scraping methods that rely on static HTML parsing are ineffective, requiring the use of headless browsers or automation frameworks to interact with the page and extract data.

To bypass these restrictions, scrapers must implement techniques such as proxy rotation and User-Agent spoofing. These methods help distribute requests across multiple IPs and simulate real user behavior, reducing the likelihood of detection and ensuring a more stable scraping process.

## 2 Special Methods to Scrape Google Maps

### 1.  Google Maps Scraping API

**Does Google provide Scraping API?**
Yes.

Many popular websites, such as Twitter and Amazon, offer their own APIs, and Google is no exception. When Google Maps API was first launched, it quickly gained widespread attention and adoption. However, before using the official API, ask yourself: Do you really need to use Google Maps API?

**Why does using the official Google Maps API not match your needsï¼Ÿ**

Let's start with pricing. Each user receives a $200 monthly free quota for Google Maps API, which includes:
- Up to 40,000 geocoding requests
- Up to 100,000 static map loads
- Up to 28,000 dynamic map loads
- Up to 40,000 route planning requests

At first glance, this quota seems sufficient, but in practice, it may not be enough. Like many other APIs, Google Maps API charges per request once the free quota is exceeded, and its pricing is relatively high. Consider this scenario: when using the Embed API, a single map load may trigger multiple API calls, such as address searches, route planning, or distance calculations, quickly consuming your quota. As your business scales, API calls increase, and Google Maps API can become a costly expense.

Beyond pricing, Google Maps API also has strict request limitations. Currently, Google enforces a rate limit of 100 requests per second, which means that in high-concurrency scenarios, access may be restricted, affecting data retrieval efficiency.

Below is a sample code snippet that you can directly integrate into your Google Maps Scraper.

> Python
```Python
import http.client
import json

conn = http.client.HTTPSConnection("api.scrapeless.com")
payload = json.dumps({
   "actor": "scraper.google.maps",
   "input": {
      "engine": "google_maps",
      "q": "coffee",
      "type": "search",
      "ll": "@40.7455096,-74.0083012,14z",
      "hl": "en",
      "gl": "us"
   }
})
headers = {
   'Content-Type': 'application/json'
}
conn.request("POST", "/api/v1/scraper/request", payload, headers)
res = conn.getresponse()
data = res.read()
print(data.decode("utf-8"))
```

> JavaScript
```JavaScript
var myHeaders = new Headers();
myHeaders.append("Content-Type", "application/json");

var raw = JSON.stringify({
   "actor": "scraper.google.maps",
   "input": {
      "engine": "google_maps",
      "q": "coffee",
      "type": "search",
      "ll": "@40.7455096,-74.0083012,14z",
      "hl": "en",
      "gl": "us"
   }
});

var requestOptions = {
   method: 'POST',
   headers: myHeaders,
   body: raw,
   redirect: 'follow'
};

fetch("https://api.scrapeless.com/api/v1/scraper/request", requestOptions)
   .then(response => response.text())
   .then(result => console.log(result))
   .catch(error => console.log('error', error));
```

## Method 2. Build Your First Google Maps Scraper with Python

### Environment setup
First, we need to set up a web scraping environment by preparing the following tools:
1. `Python`: Download it from Python's official website. It is recommended to install a version one or two releases behind the latest, rather than the newest version.

![Python](https://assets.scrapeless.com/prod/posts/google-maps-scraper/8ffca28a62ad20b109cd07f90815b8d3.png)

2. `Python IDE`: Any Python-supported IDE will work, but we recommend **PyCharm**, a specialized Python development tool. The free **PyCharm Community Edition** is sufficient.

![Python IDE](https://assets.scrapeless.com/prod/posts/google-maps-scraper/0a7dbd153556371ac34726c4333e1e75.png)

> **Note for Windows users**:
During installation, ensure that the "<u>Add python.exe to PATH</u>" option is selected. This allows you to use Python commands in the terminal. Since Python 3.4 and later include this by default, no manual setup is required.

![Add python.exe to PATH](https://assets.scrapeless.com/prod/posts/google-maps-scraper/d11a2d53671bb89c221af2dfb28492dd.png)

To check if Python is installed, open the terminal or command prompt and run:
```Bash
python --version
```

3. **A virtual environment**:Creating a virtual environment is recommended to manage dependencies and avoid conflicts with other Python projects. Navigate to your project directory in the terminal and execute the following command to create a virtual environment called "**google_flights_env**":
```Bash
python -m venv google_flights_env
```

Activate the virtual environment using the appropriate command for your OS:
- **Windows:**
```Bash
google_flights_env\Scripts\activate
```

- **macOS/Linux:**
```Bash
source google_flights_env/bin/activate
```

4. **Installing required libraries**: After activating the virtual environment, please install the necessary Python libraries for web scraping: `requests` and `BeautifulSoup4`. Install them follow our command:
```Bash
pip install requests
pip install beautifulsoup4
```

5. **Installing automation tools**: Since Google Maps does not return a direct HTML page for parsing, automation tools are needed to retrieve raw HTML.
  - Install **Selenium**, a Python automation package:
```Bash
pip install selenium
```

  - You also need to download the browser driver. Taking the most commonly used Google Chrome as an example, find the [ChromeDriver](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/chromedriver/) that matches the browser version on the official website, download and install it locally, and then place it in the code directory in PyCharm.

![ChromeDriver](https://assets.scrapeless.com/prod/posts/google-maps-scraper/acd19acdf41dd58280fb6f38272a2b03.png)

### Using Python to scrape location or navigation route data
#### Scraping locations
**Step 1**: Open Google Maps and search for "**coffee**".

![Scraping locations](https://assets.scrapeless.com/prod/posts/google-maps-scraper/2574f060aa65d587686477cffc65655e.png)

**Step 2**. **Scrape specific fields from the Google Maps search results**. 

We can use BeautifulSoup to parse the HTML and locate the elements containing the desired information. Below are some examples:
- **Scrape the coffee shop name:**

![Scrape the coffee shop name](https://assets.scrapeless.com/prod/posts/google-maps-scraper/a715ca7880081e064025925a51b2d8f6.png)

Extract the element and use Python to scrape the text data:
```Python
def scrape_title(listing):
    maps_element = listing.select_one('div.NrDZNb div.qBF1Pd.fonHeadlineSmall')
    return maps_element.text.strip()
```

- Scrape the ratings:

![Scrape the ratings](https://assets.scrapeless.com/prod/posts/google-maps-scraper/b7a12c204366170acb7a9e080560d89e.png)

Extract the element and use Python to scrape the text data. Since the rating might be empty, weâ€™ve added a null check:
```Python
def scrape_rating(listing):
    maps_element = listing.select_one('span.MW4etd[aria-hidden="true"]')
    if maps_element is None:
        return None
    else:
        return maps_element.text.strip()
```

- **Scrape the image link:**

![Scrape the image link](https://assets.scrapeless.com/prod/posts/google-maps-scraper/24c21eb92b899308a730dafea8b881f3.png)

Extract the `href` attribute of the element and use Python to scrape the image link:
```Python
def scrape_image_links(listing):
    maps_image_link = listing.select_one('div.SpFAAb').select_one("img")
    return maps_image_link['src']
```

The above is just a partial demonstration. You can refer to our final code below:

```Python
# Import necessary libraries
import time

from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
import json
from selenium import webdriver

driver = webdriver.Chrome()

# Function to scrape listing elements from Google Maps
def scrape_listings(soup):
    return soup.select('div.Nv2PK.THOPZb.CpccDe')

# Function to scrape title from google_maps
def scrape_title(listing):
    maps_element = listing.select_one('div.NrDZNb').select_one('div.qBF1Pd.fontHeadlineSmall')
    return maps_element.text.strip()

# Function to scrape ratings from google_maps
def scrape_rating(listing):
    maps_element = listing.select_one('span.MW4etd[aria-hidden="true"]')
    if maps_element is None:
        return None
    else:
        return maps_element.text.strip()

def scrape_image_links(listing):
    maps_image_link = listing.select_one('div.SpFAAb').select_one("img")
    return maps_image_link['src']

# Main function
def main():
    # Make a request to Google Maps URL and parse HTML
    url = 'https://www.google.com/maps/search/coffee/@47.4641284,-122.3855982,11z?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI1MDIwOS4wIKXMDSoASAFQAw=='
    driver.get(url)
    time.sleep(2)
    page_source = driver.page_source
    soup = BeautifulSoup(page_source, 'html.parser')

    # Scrape map listings
    listings = scrape_listings(soup)

    # Iterate through each listing and extract map information
    maps_data = []
    for listing in listings:
        title = scrape_title(listing)
        rating = scrape_rating(listing)
        image_link = scrape_image_links(listing)

        # Store map information in a dictionary
        maps_info = {
            'title': title,
            'rating': rating,
            'image_link': image_link
        }

        maps_data.append(maps_info)

    # Save results to a JSON file
    with open('google_maps_data.json', 'w') as json_file:
        json.dump(maps_data, json_file, indent=4)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

**Step 3. Scrape results and store data**. 

A JSON file named `google_maps_data.json` will be generated in your PyCharm directory, containing the scraped data. Below is an example of the scraped results:
```JSON
[
    {
        "title": "Lucky Mugs",
        "rating": null,
        "image_link": "https://streetviewpixels-pa.googleapis.com/v1/thumbnail?panoid=36eAZcAEe5VpSUaFnPcOVA&cb_client=search.gws-prod.gps&w=80&h=92&yaw=139.65103&pitch=0&thumbfov=100"
    },
    {
        "title": "Retro Coffee",
        "rating": "4.4",
        "image_link": "https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPxJNNq_ddJeY4metdP0-Yv1gfAb8hwqtdjEk3R=w80-h106-k-no"
    },
    {

        "image_link": "https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPYbEDGEskTGDCcpBHxF-nQqrFhR2yFi5cBt6Lu=w122-h92-k-no"
    }
]
```

#### Scraping navigation routes
**Step 1. Enter the origin and destination in Google Maps.**

![Scraping navigation routes](https://assets.scrapeless.com/prod/posts/google-maps-scraper/26c947df0ebef130c6dc55ac64b7ef94.png)

**Step 2. Scrape specific fields from the Google Maps navigation route search results.**

Continue using BeautifulSoup to parse the HTML and locate the elements containing the desired information:
- **Scrape the "via" field**:

![Scrape the "via" field](https://assets.scrapeless.com/prod/posts/google-maps-scraper/a0ef6485525e3ae73e36de8de30c0198.png)

  Extract the element and use Python to scrape the text data:
```Python
def scrape_via(listing):
    maps_element = listing.select_one('h1.VuCHmb.fontHeadlineSmall')
    return maps_element.text.strip()
```

- **Scrape the time**:

![Scrape the time](https://assets.scrapeless.com/prod/posts/google-maps-scraper/31ee02a44fdae3d6641abed27ebe72c2.png)

Extract the element and use Python to scrape the text data:
```Python
def scrape_time(listing):
    maps_element = listing.select_one('div.Fk3sm.fontHeadlineSmall.delay-light')
    return maps_element.text.strip()
```

- **Scrape the distance**:

![Scrape the distance](https://assets.scrapeless.com/prod/posts/google-maps-scraper/3a1282ba56af011a0b35fa4d2bacdf6e.png)

```Python
def scrape_distance(listing):
    maps_element = listing.select_one('div.ivN21e.tUEI83.fontBodyMedium').select_one('div')
    return maps_element.text.strip()
```

- Here's the final code:
```Python
# Import necessary libraries
import time

from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
import json
from selenium import webdriver

driver = webdriver.Chrome()

# Function to scrape listing elements from Google Maps
def scrape_listings(soup):
    return soup.select('div.UgZKXd')

# Function to scrape via from google_maps
def scrape_via(listing):
    maps_element = listing.select_one('h1.VuCHmb.fontHeadlineSmall')
    return maps_element.text.strip()

# Function to scrape time from google_maps
def scrape_time(listing):
    maps_element = listing.select_one('div.Fk3sm.fontHeadlineSmall.delay-light')
    return maps_element.text.strip()

# Function to scrape distance from google_maps
def scrape_distance(listing):
    maps_element = listing.select_one('div.ivN21e.tUEI8e.fontBodyMedium').select_one('div')
    return maps_element.text.strip()

# Main function
def main():
    # Make a request to google maps URL and parse HTML
    url = 'https://www.google.com/maps/dir/Austin-Bergstrom+International+Airport/5540+N+Lamar+Blvd,+Austin,+TX+78756/@30.2603068,-97.7871692,12z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m13!4m12!1m5!1m1!1s0x8644b13b8b4aff45:0x1ca7fca8c9dc2768!2m2!1d-97.6710889!2d30.194085!1m5!1m1!1s0x8644cba140fad1fb:0x2db903443245739c!2m2!1d-97.7286733!2d30.3247493?hl=en&entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI1MDIwOS4wIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D'
    driver.get(url)
    time.sleep(2)
    page_source = driver.page_source
    soup = BeautifulSoup(page_source, 'html.parser')

    # Scrape maps listings
    listings = scrape_listings(soup)

    # Iterate through each listing and extract maps information
    maps_data = []
    for listing in listings:
        via = scrape_via(listing)
        time_consuming = scrape_time(listing)
        distance = scrape_distance(listing)

        # Store maps information in a dictionary
        maps_info = {
            'via': via,
            'time': time_consuming,
            'distance': distance
        }

        maps_data.append(maps_info)

    # Save results to a JSON file
    with open('google_maps_dir_data.json', 'w') as json_file:
        json.dump(maps_data, json_file, indent=4)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

**Step 3. Scrape results and store data.**

A JSON file named `google_maps_dir_data.json` will be generated in your PyCharm directory, containing the scraped data. Below is an example of the scraped results:

```JSON
[
    {
        "via": "via 183 Toll",
        "time": "17 min",
        "distance": "13.4 miles"
    },
    {
        "via": "via State Hwy 71 W and I-35 N",
        "time": "19 min",
        "distance": "15.5 miles"
    },
    {
        "via": "via S Hwy 183 and 183 Toll",
        "time": "17 min",
        "distance": "13.6 miles"
    }
]
```
